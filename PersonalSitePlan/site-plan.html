      <!--------------------------Steps 4-8-------------------------------->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#847559]</td><td class="secondary">[#E7C24F]</td><td class="accent1">[#A43312]</td><td class="accent2">[#8F0E00]</td></tr>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
      <p>
        I chose Courier New for my heading font because it was one of the web-safe fonts that I liked the most. It stood out a bit from all the others. As for the paragraph font, I chose Tahoma becuase it wwas also a web-safe font as well as very readable.
      </p>

        Heading Font: Courier New <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is my personal website, a space where I share my life experiences, personal growth, and achievements. The website will consist of a home page, which will serve as an introduction to my website and provide links to the different sections of the site. The home page will also feature a brief bio and a profile picture of myself.  This website aims to be a customizable form of social media that I have made for myself. It features a blog section where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences. In addition, it has an About Me page and a page dedicated to showcasing my personal feats in programming or otherwise.
      </p>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The blog section is the primary focus of my website, and it will feature (hopefully) regular updates on my life experiences, personal growth, and opinions on various topics. I will share my thoughts on current events, trends, and issues that I am passionate about. The blog is a space where visitors can connect with me, share their opinions, and participate in discussions. However, as I don’t know how to code the backend, the comment section will be fake as of now.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        The About Me page is where visitors can learn more about who I am, my background, and what I am passionate about. I will share my personal story and what inspired me to create this website. It will also provide information about my education, career, and hobbies. This page will help visitors get to know me better and build a connection with me. This page will also include links to my social media profiles and other online presence.

      <h3>Personal Showcase</h3>
      <p>
        As someone who is passionate about programming, I will have a page on my website dedicated to showcasing my personal feats in primarily programming, but other achievements could also go here. This page will include projects that I have worked on, personal milestones, and anything that I am proud of achieving. It will also provide information on the technologies I have worked with, and the skills I have acquired over the years. This page will be of particular interest to people who are looking to learn more about my experience in programming. Essentially, it’s a portfolio.
