        <h2>Trey Torrez</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Trey Torrez and this is my blog/portfolio/whatever I feel like. I made this for a school project but I also made it with the intent of keeping it for a while and actually using it!</p>
        <p>Anyways, about me:
            I was born in Virginia but I only lived there for 3 years so that hardly counts. Frankly, all I can remember is that we had purple curtains, or maybe it was drapes. Either way, after that my family moved to Kansas where I lived most of my childhood and teenage years. Then, during the summer between my junior and senior high school years, I moved to Nevada where I spent my senior year. I've made tons of friends along the way and while sometimes I wish I hadn't moved, I wouldn't trade my friends for anything.</p>
            <p> From How-To books to watching the DIY channels on YouTube to just plain old trial and error, I've always been interested in learning how things work and how to make them work better. That's practically the whole reason I made this website. I wanted to learn how to make a website and I wanted to make a social page that I could customize how I wanted (as well as use to showcase my work and my interests).
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from computers I also love music and just about everything that comes with it. I've played the cello for ~8 years and I can play a lead sheeet for the piano with some proficiency. I've been in choir for the past 3-ish years and finally, I have done around 15 musicals and plays. It's something that most poeple are suprise to hear, probably because I am not as out there as some of the theater kids (or adults I guess, being an adult is odd).
