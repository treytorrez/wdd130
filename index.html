    <p>
      Hello! My name is Trey Torrez. This is my first semester at BYUI and I'm
      excited to get into programming, webdesign, etc. Computers are a huge
      passion of mine so I think this wil be lots of fun. I dont have a ton of
      knowledge in the programming sphere but that's why I'm here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came to BYUI becuase I knew it was going to be a good school (not to
      mention cheap) that also had students with values like mine. Along with
      building my knowledge I am also trying to build my testimony. So far I've
      had a good time and I can't wait for what's next.
